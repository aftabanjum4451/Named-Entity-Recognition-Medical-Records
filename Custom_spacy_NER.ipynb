These conditions include a very large colony of bats in a hot and humid cave with poor ventilation. While two human deaths in 1956 and 1959 had been tentatively attributed to aerosolization of the rabies virus after entering a cave with bats, \"investigations of the 2 reported human cases revealed that both infections could be explained by means other than aerosol transmission\".[28] It is instead generally thought that most instances of cryptic rabies are the result of an unknown bat bite.[24] Bites from a bat can be so small that they are not visible without magnification equipment, for example. Outside of bites, rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin.

It showed benefits for social phobia in five clinical trials against placebo, while the other SNRIs are not considered particularly useful for this disorder as many of them didn't undergo testing for it. As of now, it is unclear if duloxetine and desvenlafaxine can provide benefits for social anxiety sufferers. However, another class of antidepressants called MAOIs are considered effective for social anxiety, but they come with many unwanted side effects and are rarely used.

Outside of bites, rabies virus exposure can also occur if infected fluids come in contact with a mucous membrane or a break in the skin.

This is called latency[153] and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with at least one of these types of herpes virus.[154] These latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.[155]\n","Entities [('herpes simplex virus', 'Pathogen'), ('Epstein–Barr virus', 'Pathogen'), ('varicella zoster virus', 'Pathogen'), ('chickenpox', 'MedicalCondition'), ('shingles', 'MedicalCondition'), ('Yersinia pestis.[155', 'Pathogen')]\n","The following drugs are considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and anakinra. Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies and are also DMARDs.[8] Use of tocilizumab is associated with a risk of increased cholesterol levels.[87]\n","\n","Hydroxychloroquine, apart from its low toxicity profile, is considered effective in the moderate RA treatment.[88]\n","\n","The most commonly used agent is methotrexate with other frequently used agents including sulfasalazine and leflunomide.[8] Leflunomide is effective when used from 6–12 months, with similar effectiveness to methotrexate when used for 2 years.[89] Sulfasalazine also appears to be most effective in the short-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[90] Sodium aurothiomalate (gold) and cyclosporin are less commonly used due to more common adverse effects.[8] However, cyclosporin was found to be effective in the progressive RA when used up to one year.[91] Agents may be used in combinations however, people may experience greater side effects.[8][92] Methotrexate is the most important and useful DMARD and is usually the first treatment.[8][5][93] A combined approach with methotrexate and biologics improves ACR50, HAQ scores and RA remission rates.[94] Triple therapy consisting of methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine may also effectively control disease activity.[95] Adverse effects should be monitored regularly with toxicity including gastrointestinal, hematologic, pulmonary, and hepatic.[93] Side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain can be reduced by taking folic acid.[96]\n","Entities [('DMARDs', 'Medicine'), ('methotrexate', 'Medicine'), ('hydroxychloroquine', 'Medicine'), ('sulfasalazine, leflunomide', 'Medicine'), ('TNF-alpha inhibitors', 'Medicine'), ('certolizumab', 'Medicine'), ('infliximab', 'Medicine'), ('etanercept', 'Medicine'), ('Rituximab', 'Medicine'), ('tocilizumab', 'Medicine'), ('monoclonal antibodies', 'Medicine'), ('tocilizumab', 'Medicine'), ('Hydroxychloroquine', 'Medicine'), ('methotrexate', 'Medicine'), ('sulfasalazine', 'Medicine'), ('Leflunomide', 'Medicine'), ('methotrexate', 'Medicine'), ('Sulfasalazine', 'Medicine'), ('Sodium aurothiomalate', 'Medicine'), ('cyclosporin', 'Medicine'), ('cyclosporin', 'Medicine'), ('Methotrexate', 'Medicine'), ('methotrexate', 'Medicine'), ('sulfasalazine', 'Medicine'), ('hydroxychloroquine', 'Medicine'), ('nausea', 'MedicalCondition'), ('vomiting', 'Medicine'), ('abdominal pain', 'MedicalCondition')]\n","Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial to one's body, a few pathogenic bacteria can cause infectious diseases. The most common bacterial disease is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which affects about 2 million people mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus and Pseudomonas, and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, and Hansen's disease.
